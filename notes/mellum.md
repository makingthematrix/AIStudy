	Hi, @here!
	:yay::yay::yay:
Today we launched a dedicated instance of Mellum that was fine-tuned on internal code base of JetBrains! If your IDE is managed by IDE services, everything is already working out of the box while using cloud code completion with AI Assistant. As usual, your feedback is greatly appreciated, so feel free to reply in the thread :thread: or post directly to this channel.
How to enable?
	Verify that your IDE installation is managed by IDE services
	Install Toolbox App
Login to https://tbe.labs.jb.gg/
	Verify that cloud code completion is enabled in IDE settings: Settings -> Editor -> General -> Inline Completion -> Enable cloud code completion suggestions
	Enjoy!
	It would be great if you use nightly builds of the IDEs. Given this, we will be able to analyse some FUS data and check how everything is working for you at some scale.
Thanks to
